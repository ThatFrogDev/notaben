## Installation
There are a few different ways of installing Notabena:
- **Recommended way:** through SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/notabena/. This requires no knowledge or programs, but if you want to run it with `notabena` you'll need to add it to `PATH` manually. Is your architecture not in there? Consider building for all the versions and [sending the binaries in our server](https://discord.gg/htNK4YcJB8).
- **Package manager:** currently, Notabena only supports *Homebrew* for **MacOS** and **Linux**. The formula is in `chiissu/macchiato`. More package managers will be added at stable.
  - (Still unsure? `brew tap chiissu/macchiato && brew install notabena`)
- **The Rust way:** if you have Rust installed, we recommend installing it through `cargo` (`cargo install notabena`). It will automatically be added to your `PATH`.

When running Notabena on **Linux or macOS**, you might encounter an error like this when running the file:<br>
`bash: /home/Your-Username/Downloads/Your-Notabena-Installation: Permission denied`<br>
To fix this issue, **run the following command in your terminal:**<br>
Linux:
`chmod u+x /home/Your-Username/Downloads/Your-Notabena-Installation` (filling in the blanks)<br>
MacOS:
`chmod u+x /Users/Your-Username/Downloads/Your-Notabena-Installation` (filling in the blanks)<br>
The program should now run smoothly!<br>

There are no issues known with Windows installation. If you get another error or similar bug, please open an issue.
